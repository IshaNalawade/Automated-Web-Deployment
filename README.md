### Autonated Web Deployment Platform
Built a platform to automate website deployment by employing AWS container services like ECS and ECR, enabling 5,000 concurrent Docker containers.
Streamlined tasks such as cloning repositories, creating parallel code builds, and securely storing files in S3, with real-time logs and error tracking via a Redis-based publish-subscribe model displayed on a Next.js UI.
